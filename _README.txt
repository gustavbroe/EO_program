## Instructions for full optimization

1. Specify material and load parameters in *def_c* or *def_w*
2. Add or use existing EPD data in *material_info*
3. Run *column_FA* or *wall_FA* files with desired intervals and outputs (e.g. printing of figures)
4. Optimized design is now stated in the command-line.


Investigations of specific parameters can be done with other files, following similar instructions.


### Description of miscellaneous-folder

Files in this folder are not apart of the bachelor thesis.

Some files are used to check the correctness of results (*demonstrate_Emilie* and *demonstrate_Yasemin*), while others are potential improvement (*convergence_parallel_computing*) and expertimantal studies (*change_of_axial_load*).
